## Prediction-of-Traffic
### To develop a machine learning-based model that predicts future traffic patterns using historical data and relevant features like date, time, weather, and location.Traffic congestion and related problems are a common concern in urban areas. Understanding traffic patterns and analyzing data can provide valuable insights for transportation planning, infrastructure development, and congestion management. The aim is to assist in real-time traffic management, route optimization, and better urban planning.

# Data Collection:
The data is collected from Traffic.csv. The dataset contains time,date, day of week, numbers of (cars,buses,bikes and trucks),total number of vehicles and the traffic situation(which is to be predicted).

# Data visualisation:
This step the visualisation of traffic situation in every day of week and by the total number of vehicles.

# Exploratory Data Analysis:
The data is visualised by finding the uniqueness of data and separating the date into hours and minutes.

# Data Preprocessing:
The data is preprocessed by handling the categorical features. The splitting of data into training and testing.

# Training the model:
The model is trained using RandomForest classification which predicts the model with a accuracy of 84%.

# Tools used:
JupyterNotebook

# Libraries Used:
Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, gradio

# Accuracy: 82.77404921700223

# Demo:
